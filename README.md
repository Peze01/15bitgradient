# 15 Bit Gradient
Generates a gradient in the 15bit colour format for the colours between two given hexadecimal colours.
The gradient can be saved as a .nbfp Nitro Palette File.
Useful for working with GB and NDS Palettes.

# How it works

Takes two colours and creates a gradient with a specified number of colours before converting them all to 15bit format to be saved.
